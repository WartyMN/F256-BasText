# F256-BasText
This is a Foenix (partial) port of Peter Krefting's BasText program for converting Commodore BASIC files to straight text. You can use this to open C= BASIC programs on your foenix (convert to text first, open SuperBASIC, open the converted file). It does NOT do any code conversion, that's up to you!
